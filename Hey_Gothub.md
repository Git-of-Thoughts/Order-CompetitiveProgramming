# Hey Gothub

## Background

`problem_0` and `problem_1` both contain a competitive programming problem from
`codeforces`.

## Your Tasks

1. Figure out the types of variables in the Python files where I indicated with
`Hey Gothub` comments.

2. Run Black formatter on all Python files, and configure GitHub Actions to
automatically run Black on all Python files in the repository.

3. Generate 10 random valid inputs to `problem_1`. You should know how to do
this because you have the tool.
